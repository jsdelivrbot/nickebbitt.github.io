In late 2015 I arranged for Heinz Kabutz (Java Champion and the man behind [javaspecialists.eu](http://javaspecialists.eu/) to visit the company I work for and teach his Java Specialist Master course to my team.

The training was great but a nice bonus for myself was a personal invite from Heinz to attend the Java focused [JCrete Unconference](http://www.jcrete.org/) he runs on the Greek island of, you guessed it, Crete.

The invite put me into the hat to attend the unconference and I was luck to be one of those picked out to attend. It was an offer too good to refuse so I accepted and decided to worry about the money side of it later.

It turned out to be a great decision and one of the most, if not the most, rewarding weeks of my career.

Arriving in Kolymbari a day before the conference started I decided to take a stroll down the sea front. I was passing the strip of restaurants and heard the mention of GlassFish from one of the tables. With a Java conference happening in the same town the coming week I knew this was no coincidence so approached the table and asked "Did someone just say GlassFish?". Luckily they had and I didn't look daft. The Java people in question were actually members of the Netbeans dream team, Zoran Sevarac, Toni Epple and Geertan Wielenga. Interestingly the reason they were talking about GlassFish was actually nothing to do with Java, but rather [Jazz harmonica album created by Geertan's partner] (http://www.herminedeurloo.com/cds/glass-fish/).

Following the fortunate meetup Zoran, Toni and I decided to sample a few local "Cocktails on the Rocks!". This set the scene for the coming week - the friendliness from these people I'd only just met was superb.
