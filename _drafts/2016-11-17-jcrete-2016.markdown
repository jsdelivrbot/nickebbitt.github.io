In late 2015 I arranged for Heinz Kabutz (Java Champion and the man behind [javaspecialists.eu](http://javaspecialists.eu/) to visit the company I work for and teach his Java Specialist Master course to my team.

The training was great but a nice bonus for myself was a personal invite from Heinz to attend the Java focused [JCrete Unconference](http://www.jcrete.org/) he runs on the Greek island of, you guessed it, Crete.
