I've been developing software for a living for around 15 years.

I first started been writing code as a boy playing around on a BBC Master typing in LOGO commands to control a Turtle. Little did I know that this would sew the seeds of an obsession with computers, coding and technology for the rest of my life!

After dossing around during my A-levels and not being too excited with the idea of another 3-4 years of education I decided to try and get a full-time job in computing rather than go to Uni. Following a number of letters to IT companies enquiring about any opportunities without a single reply I decided to enroll at the local Uni and study for a degree in Computing. I chose to study part-time to leave my options open if the chance to work full-time arose.

This proved to be a good move as shortly after starting my degree I was offered a 6 months contract with an insurance company in their IT department. The company was happy for me to continue my study alongside the roll which was perfect.

This role gave me a taste for what real software development was all about. I was tasked with migrating an MS Access application to SQL Server with a Visual Basic client - I know what your thinking, "...exciting stuff!!".

10 years later I was still with company having progressed through various positions from Junior Programmer to Lead Developer / Solutions Architect. My core skill set throughout this time was predominantly database focused. I worked with SQL Server from a business / management information perspective before moving onto Oracle developing the core business application supporting the quoting, sales and accounting of Insurance transactions.

In the final few years I was involved the support and maintenance of the company's Java based online "Quote & Buy" website and subsequently the integration of the quoting engine with 3rd party insurance aggregators. At this point I thought I knew Java and Object Oriented programming, in reality I hadn't even scratched the surface. Yeah I could write lines of Java code but I sure wasn't writing clean, well designed, programs.

Towards the end of my time with the company my role became less hands-on which ultimately triggered my decision to make a move. Whilst I found the Solutions Architecture side of things very interesting and valuable (particularly DDD) the role helped me realise that solving problems with code is ultimately what motivates me. I enjoy the design process but then being able follow that up with the implementation is what gives me a buzz.

With the core of my experience being Oracle based I started looking for a more development focused role in that area and soon found a suitable opportunity with a software house providing services to the rail industry. This began as a run of the mill Oracle developer role but around 6 months I was asked to get involved with a Java based application that integrated a "backend" system with a 3rd party mobile offering.

At this point I realised that the Java knowledge I already had was limited and my understanding of Object Oriented concepts and design patterns was fairly basic. I decided it was essential to approach this new opportunity in the right way so started diving deeper into Java and Object Oriented design, as well general best practices in relation to development such as clean code and automated testing.

A few years later and Java is at the core of everything I do now.
