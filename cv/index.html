  <h2><i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> Community</h2>
  <p>My passion for software development has led me to become involved in local tech groups such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManchesterUK-Java-Community/">Manchester Java Community (MJC)</a> for which I have recently become a co-leader.</p>
  <p>I see groups such as the MJC as vital to helping like-minded people in the region to network and develop their careers. It is a great privilege to be involved with the group and I'm looking forward to giving a lot back to the community over the coming years.</p>
  <p>Other local groups that I look to attend regularly are XP Manchester and Agile Manchester.</p>
  <p>I aim to get to relevant technical conferences where possible either through work or self-funded if necessary. I see this as very important for personal development, helping me to keep to up-to-date with the latest trends and provide ideas that I can apply in my work.</p>
