		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Nick Ebbitt</span> and I'm a software engineer currently
			working as a Lead Developer in Manchester for a software house providing services to the UK rail industry.</p>

		<p>I have a passion for software development, particularly the processes involved in delivering change. The ability to deliver value regularly in a controlled automated fashion is central to the way I work.</p>

		<p>I love writing code with core strengths in Object Oriented languages (Java) and relational databases (Oracle). I also have an understanding of other programming paradigms such as functional. I'm comfortable with the design and architecture of complex systems.</p>

		<p>Quality of software is very important to me. I utilise suitable tools & techniques to implement various flavours of tests. I believe that testing is a core part of the developers role in implementing a feature and should be valued highly.</p>

		<p>I view team culture as a key element to successful software delivery. I make it a responsibility of mine to help to nurture a positive team environment where safety, quality and continuous improvement are highly valued.</p>

		<p>This site hosts my development blog, CV and general info about things I'm up to in relation to software development.</p>
