Following [JCrete](http://www.jcrete.org/) in the summer of 2016 I returned inspired by the people I had met and highly motivated to become more involved
in the local tech community. This led me to attend more events such as XP Manchester and the Manchester Java Community (MJC). I also offered to speak at a future MJC event if they would be open to that.

In October 2016 I did my first (and only so far) public tech talk for the MJC. Following this I caught up with Alison McGreavy who founded the MJC back in 2013 for some feedback. She provided some useful feedback and then to my surprise she asked if I'd like to help run the event along with her and Debbie Roycroft. At this point I had little idea what it would involve but decided to dive right in and accepted her offer.

This is my review of the events I was involved in this year, as well as my thoughts being involved in the community.

## January: Hazelcast for the cloud, with Spring Boot, Atomist and Eureka

At the first event of the year, and the first I helped out with, we had Neil Stevenson from Hazelcast speaking about all things Hazelcast. As per the buzz-word heavy talk title he was using SpringBoot to demonstrate various features as well as an interesting tool called [Atomist](https://atomist.com/).

## March: JBake. Static site generation ... on the JVM!

In March, we held an event at a new venue to us called Rise. [JBake](http://jbake.org/) is a Java based, open source, static site/blog generator for developers & designers. [Jonathan Bullock](https://twitter.com/jonbullock) (creator of JBake) travelled over from North Wales to give us a great intro to creating a static website with JBake.

More interesting from my perspective were the insights into the open-source community that Jonathan provided. His passion for Java and software in general shone through.

## April: 4th Birthday Kata

April marked the 4th anniversary since the MJC was founded by Alison McGreavy at MadLab. Only four people attended the event and the group has grown to over 700 members in those 4 years which is a great achievement.

We decided to hold a more hands-on pratical meetup for this event and found what looked like an interesting birthday themed kata designed by Matteo Vaccari based on exploring the software design pattern known as Hexagonal Architecture or Ports & Adapters.

This was my first experience of a hands-on session and I thought it was great. We had people working in pairs whilst Debbie Roycroft and I helped to ensure noone become stuck.

There was also lots of cake!

## June: Java 9

With the release on Java 9 on the horizon Debbie Roycroft spoke about some of the upcoming features that would be available.

The highlight of this for me was the intro to the module system aka Project Jigsaw. I'd heard quite a lot about it due its controversial nature howvere didn't really know much about how it worked. The idea of being able to create a lightweight Java runtime with just the libraries from the JDK that were necessary for the app was intriguing.

## July: Java with Docker & Azure

In July we were joined by Microsoft who provided us with an in depth overview of the Docker support available on Azure. While fairly light on Java content, this talk was really interesting in that we were shown lots of useful features available on Azure. It was brought to our attention that Microsoft contribute more to open-source software than any other organisation which was really surprising.

## August: Java 9 Hackday

The Java 9 hackday was a special event held on a Saturday afternoon. The hack was organised by the JCP and we joined up online with various JUGs from around the world.

This session was really useful as it built upon the Java 9 meetup in June as we learned much about the module system and mor importantly by joining in with the hack we contributed to the delivery of Java 9 through the feedback we provided.

## August: Java libraries you can't afford to miss

In August we held our first event with a remote speaker. We had originally planned for Andres Almiray to visit us in Manchester and speak however due to unforseen circumstances he was unable to travel but still offered to speak albeit remotely. 

This was an interesting opportunity for us to explore the technicalities around hosting a remote speaker that had the potential to open up the possibility for more remote speakers in the future.

Although we were stepping out of our comfort zone for this it proved to be worth the extra stress. The event went smoothly, all the worries about connectivity and having the ability to communcate effectively with the speaker were unnecessary. The sound quality in the room we used for the meetup wasn't ideal but we leared a good lesson for future events from this. 

Most importantly, Andres was a great speaker and shared some really useful content related to various key Java libraries. I'd recommend people reach out to him to speak at their events as I'm sure he'd be more than happy to speak either in person or remotely.

The recording of this event is available on the MJC YouTube channel.

## November: Nikhil Nanivadekar

One of the highlights of the year for me was the visit of Nikhil Nanivadekar. I first met Nikhil at JCrete in 2016 and we have remained friends since. He visited Manchester in the summer of 2017 and I joked that he should visit again soon and speak at the MJC. A few months later and he was back as part of a tour that took him to London, Belfast, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham. You can read more abou this [here](link).

Nikhil is the project lead for the [Eclispse Collections](https://www.eclipse.org/collections/) open-source project and he provided a very entertaining talk comparing Eclipse Collections with other collections libraries such as those available in the JDK, Guava, Apache Collections and Vavr. 

The passion for his work shone through during his talk which, when added to his unique sense of humour, made this the highlight of the year for me.
