I [blogged](../../../2017/04/16/looking-forward-to-junit5) about some of the upcoming features in [JUnit 5](http://junit.org/junit5/) a few months ago but one area I didn't cover was [dynamic tests](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dynamic-tests).

With the recent news that JUnit 5 has reached [GA[(http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#release-notes-5.0.0)] status I thought I'd take another look and fill in the gap in my understanding.

The feature is currently flagged as experimental, along with others such as [paramterized tests](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests) meaning there is a chance the implementation could change.
