My name's Nick Ebbitt.

I'm a software engineer currently working as a Lead Developer in Manchester for a software house providing services to the UK rail industry.

I have a passion for software development, particularly the processes involved in delivering change. The ability to deliver value regularly in a controlled automated fashion is central to the way I work.

I am flexible and pragmatic when it comes the tools & techniques used to deliver change. I rely on lean, agile and XP practices wherever possible.

I love writing code with core strengths in Object Oriented languages (Java), relational databases (Oracle) and I have an understanding of other paradigms such as functional.

Quality of software is very important to me. I utilise suitable tools & techniques to implement various flavours of tests. I believe that testing is a core part of the developers role in implementing a feature and should be valued highly.

I view team culture as a key element to successful software delivery. I make it a responsibility of mine to help to nurture a positive team environment where safety, quality and continuous improvement are valued highly.

This site hosts my development blog, CV and general info about things I'm up to in relation to software development.
