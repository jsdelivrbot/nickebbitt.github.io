I've been developing software for a living for around 15 years.

I first started been writing code as a boy playing around on a BBC Master typing in LOGO commands to control a Turtle. Little did I know that this would sew the seeds of an obsession with computers, coding and technology for the rest of my life!

After dossing around during my A-levels and not being to excited with the idea of another 3-4 years of education I decided to try and get a full-time job in IT rather than go to Uni. Following a number of letters to IT companies enquiring about any opportunities without a single reply I decided to enroll at the local Uni and study for a degree in Computing. I chose to study part-time to leave my options open if the chance to work full-time arose.

This proved to be a good move as shortly after starting my degree I was offered a 6 months contract with an insurance company in their IT department. The company was happy for me to continue my study alongside the roll which was perfect.

This role gave me a taste for what real software development was all about. I was tasked with migrating an MS Access application to SQL Server with a Visual Basic client - I know what your thinking, "...exciting stuff!!".

10 years later I was still with company having progressed through various positions from Junior Programmer to Lead Developer / Solutions Architect. My core skill set throughout this time was predominantly database focused. I worked with SQL Server from a business / management information perspective before moving onto Oracle developing the core business application supporting the quoting, sales and accounting of Insurance transactions.

In the final few years I was involved in the design and implementation of the companies online presence creating a "Quote & Buy" site using Java/JSF and subsequently integrating with 3rd party insurance aggregators.

Towards the end of my time with the company my role became less hands-on which ultimately triggered my decision to make a move. Whilst I found the Solutions Architecture side of software development very interesting and valuable (particularly DDD) the role helped me realise that writing code is ultimately what motivates me. I enjoy the design process but then being able to implement that design and solve problems with code is what gives me a buzz.
