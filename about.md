My name's Nick Ebbitt.

I'm a software engineer currently working as a Lead Developer in Manchester for a software house providing services to the UK rail industry.

I have a passion for software development, particularly the processes involved in delivering change. The ability to deliver changes regularly in a controlled automated fashion is central to the way I work. 

I am fairly pragmatic when it comes to choosing a "development methodology" however agile and lean techniques are central to the was I work.

I have a keen interest in programming languages with core strengths in relational databases, OO languages (i.e. Java) and I have an understanding of other paradigms such as functional.

Quality of software is very important to me. I utilise suitable tools & techniques to write and execute various flavours of tests. I believe that testing is a core part of the developers role in implementing a feature and should be valued highly.

This site hosts my development blog, CV and general info about things I'm up to in relation to software development.
